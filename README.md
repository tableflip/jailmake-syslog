JAILmake syslog server
======================

Figure out who's in JAIL from the mac addresses of connected users.

##Â Get started

```shell
 npm install
 sudo node index.js
```

The router is currently configured to syslog to `10.0.1.2`, so you need to have that IP address to get any useful logs...
